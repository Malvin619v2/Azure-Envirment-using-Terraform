# Azure-Envirment-using-Terraform

I created Terraform modules that can build an environment with different attributes and featrures:
 
•	Resource Groups

•	Network

•	Network Security Group on Subnet

•	Rule to restrict access solely to the Load balancer public IP

•	Load balancer

•	Public Ip (static)

•	Virtual Machines

•	Whichever OS and size

•	Assign to the backend of the load balancer

•	 Build a key vault in a separate resource group and generate new certificates.

•	Installcertificates to the virtual machines 

•	Changing the number of VMs

•	A naming convention that is clear and will not clash with a large number of nodes
